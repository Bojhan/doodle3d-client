# How to build

## Prerequisites
- get `npm`, the Node.js package manager, for instance using macports on OSX.
- (prerequisite) install Grunt: `sudo pm install -g grunt-cli`.
- run `npm install` in the project root to install project dependencies

Finally run grunt to build minified css and js files. By default, it will keep
running to automatically rebuild when source files are changed.
