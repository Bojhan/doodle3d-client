# How to build

## Prerequisites
- install npm, the Node.js package manager: `sudo port install npm`
- install Grunt: `sudo npm install -g grunt-cli`
- run `npm install` in the project root to install project dependencies

Finally run grunt to build minified css and js files. By default, it will keep
running to automatically rebuild when source files are changed.
